            <br>

             <p>I heard great feedback about the code academy and GSG many times before from my family, friends, and on social media when I was studying at the university, and I was so interested in joining the program to improve my soft and technical skills and finding a job as a web developer, since Web development was always my passion since I was in school, my favorite subject was Information technology. and I was always enjoying creating things using programming languages.
                I'm so excited about the idea that I can take the benefit of this Bootcamp and be able to know how to code and code well, in 16 weeks.
